### Hi there 👋

Thanks for visiting my github profile!  On git, I go by CodeALaMode, but my real name is Reid.  😁

If I had to describe myself, I'd say that...
- I am a collaborator who excels in cross-functional work and executing big picture ideas. I find enjoyment in sorting through the clutter to find the best route.
- I'm a language aficionado, and I love to learn about pretty much anything.
- I prefer cookie dough over a baked cookie any day of the week.
- I'm a people person.  In my world, there are no strangers - just friends I haven't met yet!
- I've got a background including logistics, education, sales, and food service.  I believe that a jack of all trades is oftentimes better than a master of one.

See some of my work!
